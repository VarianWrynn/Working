The trade war between China and the United States began in 2018 when the US imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, citing alleged unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. In response, China retaliated with its own tariffs on US goods, and the two countries have been engaged in a tit-for-tat trade dispute ever since.

The trade war has had significant economic impacts on both countries, with industries and businesses on both sides being affected by the tariffs and trade barriers. The dispute has also had geopolitical implications, as it has strained relations between the two superpowers and raised concerns about global trade and economic stability.
